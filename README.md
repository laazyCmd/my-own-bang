## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction
>An extension that allows you to create your own shortcuts to take your search results to other sites, without being dependent on a single search engine. 

This is based on DuckDuckGo's bang feature, I originally made this to compliment the said feature but I expanded on it instead.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, I have decided not to release this on Firefox's addon store because I thought of this as a simple/side project -- you are free to fork this, do your own modifications, and distribute it.

&nbsp;

## ðŸ”§ Installation
### **Firefox**
You can find the XPI file for this extension [at the Releases section](https://github.com/laazyCmd/my-own-bang/releases), along with the zipped source code and hashes.

### **Chromium**
Sorry, not tested nor available for chromium-based browsers!

&nbsp;

â›” This **may not work on certain search engines**, such as Startpage or SearX, because the extension relies on query parameters from search engines' URL.
